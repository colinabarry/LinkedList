# LinkedList
This is a simple, singly linked list implementation in C.
It is a slightly modified version of the code from [Jacob Sorber's Linked List video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOpjAHCee7c&ab_channel=JacobSorber).
This project is a step in my journey to learn the C language to improve my core programming skills.

## Made With
- WSL 2 running Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS on Windows 11
- VSCode 1.63.0
- GNU Make 4.21.1
- clang 10.0.0-4ubuntu1
